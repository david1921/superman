<h5>What is the Jumponit Deal?</h5>
<p>Each day one incredible deal is featured 
as the Jumponit Deal. The offer is only available for a limited amount 
of time, so make sure to check back frequently so you don't miss out!</p>

<h5>How do I buy today's Jumponit Deal?</h5>
<p>Click on the "Buy Now" button before 
midnight on the day the offer expires.</p>

<h5>What happens after I buy a Jumponit Deal?</h5>
<p>After you make a purchase, you'll 
receive the Jumponit Deal voucher to print out via email. Take the Jumponit Deal to the store
or merchant any time before the expiration date to enjoy the fruits 
of your labor.  </p>

<h5>What if I want to use just part 
of the Jumponit Deal voucher and save the rest for later? </h5>
<p>Sorry, you're going to have to use 
that sweet deal in just one visit. However, some merchants may be willing 
to work with you if this situation arises. </p>

<h5>If my name is on the Jumponit Deal voucher, can the merchant charge my account? </h5>
<p>No. The merchant does not have your 
account information. That is held by Analog Analytics, the software 
company that processes the transaction for the publisher. </p>

<h5>Is the transaction safe for me to use?</h5>
<p>Yes. The transaction uses SSL and other 
industry standard security features to ensure that no one else has access 
to your credit card information.  </p>

<h5>When I gift the Jumponit Deal to a friend, will they have access to my account information? </h5>
<p>No, on the Jumponit Deal voucher, 
there is a record of the transaction, the purchaser's name and the 
gifted consumer's name, along with a unique 8-digit code.  The 
payment information is secure on a site that no consumer has access 
to.  </p>

<h5>Can I combine the Jumponit Deal with other offers the merchant might have presented previously? </h5>
<p>No, each Jumponit Deal has its own 
terms.  </p>

<h5>What if the merchant does not honor the offer?</h5>
<p>We go out of our way to vet each advertiser 
and make sure they live up to our high standards.  We will also 
provide recent reviews or testimonials to help you get a better feel 
for what you are buying. On the rare occurrence that something happens 
and you're not satisfied, we (through Analog Analytics) will refund 
the offer.  </p>

<h5>What if I miss the expiration date?</h5>
<p>If you miss the expiration date on 
your deal, take heart, all is not lost! While the additional discounts 
are no longer available, you are still entitled to goods and services 
equal to the paid value of the voucher. </p>
<p>For example, if you spend <%= number_to_currency(25, :unit => @publisher.currency_symbol) %> to buy 
a <%= number_to_currency 50, :unit => @publisher.currency_symbol %> voucher for your new favorite restaurant, but are unable to get 
there before the expiration date, you will still be entitled to <%= number_to_currency 25, :unit => @publisher.currency_symbol %> 
of food, drink and good times. </p>

<h5>What if I have more questions?</h5>
<p>Feel free to email <%= mail_to(@publisher.support_email_address, nil, :target => "_blank") %> or call (877) 538-4617.
The <%= @publisher.brand_name %> and
Analog Analytics teams will be more than happy to answer any additional questions you may have. </p>
