<h3 style="text-align: center">TERMS OF SALE</h3>

	<p>By using this site you agree, for the benefit of Entercom Communications Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively <strong>“Entercom”</strong>), to the terms and conditions set forth herein.  If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, do not utilize this site.  All certificates purchased from this site or any other website or micro-site associated with Entercom are promotional certificates that may be used to obtain goods or services from participating merchants (<strong>“Merchants”</strong>).  All Certificates are subject to these terms and conditions.</p>

	<p>You are required to create an account in order to purchase a Certificate.  This is required so Entercom can provide you with easy access to print your orders, view your past purchases, modify your preferences, and to ensure permissible use of your Certificates.  You are responsible for all activity occurring when the Site is accessed through your account and you shall abide by all applicable local, state, national and foreign laws, treaties and regulations in connection with your use of the Site.  It is your responsibility to take appropriate actions immediately if any password has been stolen, leaked, compromised or otherwise used without proper consent.  For information about Entercom’s collection of personal information, please view <a href="{{ publisher.privacy_path }}">Entercom’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

	<p>The Merchant, not Entercom, is the seller of the goods and services and is solely responsible for redeeming any Certificates you purchase.  For avoidance of doubt, Entercom sells the Certificate that can be redeemed in connection with your purchase of the goods or services from the Merchant.</p>

	<p>As the issuer of the Certificate, the Merchant is fully responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the Merchant, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed Certificates or portions thereof.</p>

	<p>Neither Entercom nor the Merchant is responsible for lost or stolen Certificates.  Reproduction, sale or trade of a Certificate is prohibited unless done so in compliance with applicable law.  Any attempted redemption not consistent with these terms & conditions will render the Certificate void to the extent prohibited by law.</p>

	<p><strong>YOU WAIVE, AND RELEASE ENTERCOM AND ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS FROM, ANY CLAIM, LIABILITIES, LOSS, DAMAGES, INJURY AND/OR DEATH ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO (I) ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF MERCHANT; (II) THE SERVICES/GOODS PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CERTIFICATES; AND (III) MERCHANT’S COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.</strong></p>

	<p>Certificates are redeemable in their entirety and on a one time basis only and may not be redeemed incrementally, unless otherwise required by law.</p>

	<p>Certificate cannot be combined with any other vouchers, third party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by Merchant.  Any attempted redemption not consistent with these terms and conditions will render the Certificates null and void.</p>

	<p>Each Certificate expires on the date specified, except that the Merchant may continue to redeem the unused cash value you paid for the Certificate (which is usually less than the original face value of the Certificate) to the extent required by applicable law.</p>

	<p>According to applicable law, the Merchant may be responsible for allowing you to redeem a Certificate for the cash value based on the money you actually paid for the Certificate (i.e. if you paid $20 for a Certificate which gives you $50 of value to the Merchant, the cash value that you paid is $20, not $50), for a period of time that extends beyond the expiration date on the Certificate.  While the expiration date on the Certificate dictates the last date that you can use your Certificate for the promotional offer stated, applicable law may provide that the Merchant is responsible for honoring the cash value that you paid for your Certificate for a period of time beyond the expiration date stated on the Certificate.  In other words, you should be allowed to redeem the cash value (or purchase price) of a Certificate up until the greater of: (i) the Certificate’s expiration date; or (ii) the minimum length of time allowed by applicable law for a Certificate to expire.</p>

	<p>If you redeem a Certificate for less than its face value, you will only be entitled to a credit or cash from the Merchant equal to the difference between the face value and the amount you redeemed, if required by applicable law.  You will only be entitled to a continuing redemption value as noted above if the amount that you paid for the Certificate exceeds the amount you redeemed.  For example, if you paid $15 for a Certificate which entitles you to purchase $30 of product/services by March 1, 2011 and you make a purchase for $20 on December 31, 2010, you will only be entitled to a credit or cash equal to the difference between the $30 face value and the amount you redeemed from the Merchant (i.e., $10) if required by applicable law.  You will not have any redemption value either because the amount you redeemed is more than what you paid for the Certificate.</p>

	<p>In the event that you have an expired Certificate and would like to redeem it for the price you paid to acquire it, please contact the Merchant.  The Merchant should allow such redemption if applicable law requires it, and Entercom has instructed the Merchant to do so.  If you have gone to the Merchant and the Merchant has refused to redeem the cash value of your expired Certificate, and if applicable law entitles you to such redemption, then please contact Entercom to explain your situation and Entercom will refund the purchase price of the Certificate in either U.S. Dollars or credit for purchases of future Certificates.</p>

	<p>Entercom and the Merchants reserve all rights and remedies against you to the extent you violate these Terms of Sale, including without limitation counterfeiting Certificates or otherwise engaging in fraudulent conduct.  Entercom reserves the right to make changes to this site and these disclaimers, terms and conditions at any time without notice.</p>

	<p>For restaurant specific Certificates: (i) redemption frequency is determined by the restaurant Merchant; (ii) use of Certificates for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the restaurant Merchant and is subject to compliance with applicable law; (iii) Certificates cannot be used for taxes, tips or prior balances, unless permitted by the restaurant Merchant; and (iv) Certificates are valid for dine in only unless otherwise stated.</p>

	<p>For non restaurant Certificates: (i) Certificates may be applied only to merchandise sold by Merchant, and may not be applied to shipping or handling charges; (ii) Limit one (1) Certificate per redemption; and (iii) only one Certificate can be used per order unless otherwise specified by Merchant.</p>
	
		<p>In the event of a controversy or claim(s) arising out of, or relating to, the Certificate(s) or the uses thereof, including, but not limited to, all claims arising under any federal, state or local statute or regulation, any tort, contract or common law claim, and claims arising under these Terms of Sale, you can initiate a dispute resolution process by sending an email to <a href="mailto:MyPerks@Entercom.com">MyPerks@Entercom.com.</a> If the controversy or claim is not addressed to your satisfaction within thirty (30) days, all such claims shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (Expedited Procedures) of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, provided that the arbitrator shall not be permitted to consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Any such arbitration shall take place only in the metropolitan area in which Entercom’s business offices are located (for the applicable market where the Certificate was purchased), provided that if your primary residence is located more than 50 miles from such Entercom offices, you may elect (in your discretion) to conduct the arbitration either by submission of briefs or by telephone. Notwithstanding any contrary rule or procedure, you agree to waive any right to bring, maintain, or participate in, or recover any relief from, a class or representative action against Entercom, its affiliates, or any of their respective employees or other agents to the maximum extent permitted by law. You further agree that if included within a class or representative action, you will take all steps necessary to opt-out of the action or refrain from opting in, as the case may be.</p>
