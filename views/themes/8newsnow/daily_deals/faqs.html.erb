<h4>What is the Deal of the Day?</h4>
<p>Each day one incredible deal is featured 
as the Deal of the Day. The offer is only available for a limited amount 
of time, so make sure to check back frequently so you don’t miss out!</p>

<h4>How do I buy today’s Deal of the Day?</h4>
<p>Click on the “Buy Now” button before midnight on the day the offer expires.  Send the deal to your friends and 
tweet it, facebook it or text it to everyone you think might be interested. </p>

<h4>What happens after I buy a Deal of the Day?</h4>
<p>After you make a purchase, you’ll 
receive the Deal of the Day voucher to print out via  email. 
</p>

<p>Take the Deal of the Day to the store
or merchant any time before the expiration date to enjoy the fruits 
of your labor.  </p>

<h4>What if I want to use just part 
of the Deal of the Day voucher and save the rest for later? </h4>
<p>Sorry, you’re going to have to use 
that sweet deal in just one visit. However, some merchants may be willing 
to work with you if this situation arises </p>

<h4>If my name is on the Deal of the Day voucher, can the merchant charge my account? </h4>
<p>No. The merchant does not have your 
account information. That is held by Analog Analytics, the software 
company that processes the transaction for the publisher. </p>

<h4>Is the transaction safe for me to use?</h4>
<p>Yes. The transaction uses SSL and other 
industry standard security features to ensure that no one else has access 
to your credit card information.  </p>

<h4>When I gift the Deal of the Day to a friend, will they have access to my account information? </h4>
<p>No, on the Deal of the Day voucher, 
there is a record of the transaction, the purchaser’s name and the 
gifted consumer’s name, along with a unique 8-digit code.  The 
payment information is secure on a site that no consumer has access 
to.  </p>

<h4>Can I combine the Deal of the Day with other offers the merchant might have presented previously? </h4>
<p>No, each Deal of the Day has its own 
terms.  </p>

<h4>What if the merchant does not honor the offer?</h4>
<p>We go out of our way to vet each advertiser 
and make sure they live up to our high standards.  We will also 
provide recent reviews or testimonials to help you get a better feel 
for what you are buying. On the rare occurrence that something happens 
and you’re not satisfied, we (through Analog Analytics) will refund 
the offer.  </p>

<h4>Can I return my purchase?</h4>
<p>All sales are final. If you have a problem with your purchase, please contact the business first. If you still require assistance, please contact us within 48 hours of the close of the deal. Requests made after 48 hours cannot be processed due to the limited timeframe of the deals.</p>

<h4>What if I miss the expiration date?</h4>
<p>If you miss the expiration date on 
your deal, take heart, all is not lost! While the additional discounts 
are no longer available, you are still entitled to goods and services 
equal to the paid value of the voucher. </p>
<p>For example, if you spend $25 to buy 
a $50 voucher for your new favorite restaurant, but are unable to get 
there before the expiration date, you will still be entitled to $25 
of food, drink and good times. </p>
