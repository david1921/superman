Generally, any communication which End User posts to Analog Analytics (whether in chat rooms, discussion groups, message boards or otherwise) is considered to be non-confidential.

<h3>14. Third Party Content.</h3>
<p>Analog Analytics and Publisher, similar to an Internet Service Provider, is a distributor (and not a publisher) of content supplied by third parties and End Users on the Site. Accordingly, neither Analog Analytics nor Publisher has editorial control over such content. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by third parties, including information providers, or any other end users are those of the respective author(s) or distributors) and not of Analog Analytics or Publisher. Neither Analog Analytics, Publisher nor any third-party provider of information guarantees the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any content, nor its merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose.

In many instances, the content available through this Site represents the opinions and judgments of the respective information provider, end user, or other user not under contract with Analog Analytics or Publisher. Neither Analog Analytics nor Publisher endorses or is responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, or statement made on the Site by anyone other than authorised employee spokespersons acting in official capacities. Under no circumstances will Analog Analytics or Publisher be liable for any loss or damage caused by  End User's reliance on information obtained through the Site.  It is the responsibility of End User to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice, etc., or other content available through the Site.

The Site contains links to third party Web sites maintained by other content providers. These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by Analog Analytics or Publisher of the contents on such third-party sites and Analog Analytics and Publisher hereby expressly disclaim any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such third-party Web sites.</p> 

<h3>15. Miscellaneous.</h3>
<p>This Agreement and any operating rules for vouchers established by Analog Analytics constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder is a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall be of no legal force or effect. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions contained in this Agreement and the remaining portions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of either party to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights or any other rights provided hereunder.

Legal issues arising out of, but not exclusive to the use of, this Site or the Third Party Sites (unless otherwise specifically stated) are governed by and in accordance with English law  (exclusive of its rules regarding conflicts of laws). By using this Site, End User agrees that the courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdication to determine any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the performance, breach or termination thereof, or the Site or any Third Party Site.</p>
