	Define a module for configuring the javascript on the show deal page.
	The deal page can contain the following javascript elements:
		
		- dealsTickers 	- responsible for updating the side deals countdown values
		- DealTicker 	- responsible for updating the countdown values
		- NumberSold 	- responsible for updating the number sold
		- Buttons			- responsible for updating the buttons based on deal state
		- Status			- responsible for updating the status text
		
	The default module only needs to define dealUrl. If you want to use the side deals
	tickers then you need to include sideDealsUrl.
	
	============================   Deal Ticker   ==================================
	
	To customize the deal ticker, you need to provide a dealTickerConfig object.  If you
	wanted to use a different css selector for the timer, then you can do the
	following:
	
		define({
			dealUrl: "....",
			dealTickerConfig: {
				selector: "my-new-selector"
			}
		});
		
	The avaliable configuration options are:
	
		- selector 						- this is the css selector for the timer (default: '#time_left_to_buy')
		- includeDay 					- if true, the timer will include the day (default will no include day)
		- formatTimeRemaining - is a function that accepts day, hour, min, sec.  The default is:  hh:mm:ss
		
	========================   Deals Ticker   ===============================

	To customize the side deals tickers or public_index tickers, you need to provide a dealsTickerConfig 
	object.  If you wanted to use a different css selector for the timer, then you can do the
	following:

		define({
			dealUrl: "....",
			dealsUrl: "....",
			dealsTickerConfig: {
				selectorPrefix: "my-new-selector-prefix"
			}
		});

	The avaliable configuration options are:

		- selectorPrefix 			- this is the css selector for the timer (default: '#time_left_to_buy_')
		- includeDay 					- if true, the timer will include the day (default will no include day)
		- formatTimeRemaining - is a function that accepts day, hour, min, sec.  The default is:  hh:mm:ss
			
  ============================ NumberSold =================================
	
	To customize the number sold, you need to provide a numberSoldConfig object.  The only
	customization at this time is to change the css selector for the numberSold.  For example,
	to use '.sold' as the selector, then you can do the following:
	
		define({
			dealUrl: "...",
			numberSoldConfig: {
				selector: '.sold'
			}
		});
		
	The available configuration options are:
		
		- selector - this is the css selector for the numberSold (default: '#deals_sold')
	
	============================  Buttons  ==================================
