<h3><strong>ClickedIn.com Terms of Use</strong></h3>

<p>We reserve the right to change these Terms of Use at any time.&nbsp; Such changes will be effective when posted.&nbsp; By continuing to use the site after we post any such changes, you accept the Terms of Use as modified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We also reserve the right to deny access to this site, or to any features of this site, for any reason, including for violations of these Terms of Use.</p>
<p><strong>Deals and Vouchers</strong></p>
<p>This website allows you to, among other things, purchase group promotions at discounted prices for redemption at participating merchants near you.&nbsp; We call these promotions &ldquo;Deals.&rdquo;&nbsp; You will receive a voucher for any Deals that you purchase (a &ldquo;Voucher&rdquo;).&nbsp; The Voucher will represent: (i) a paid portion equal to the amount you are charged for it (the &quot;paid portion&quot;); and (ii) at no additional charge to you, a promotional portion for the balance of the value of the Deal if used by the promotional expiration date on the Voucher (the &quot;promotional portion&quot;).&nbsp; If you redeem your Voucher for less than the full amount stated on the Voucher, your purchase will be allocated first against the paid portion until it has a balance of zero dollars ($0.00) and then against the promotional portion that is remaining.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You may keep your Vouchers for yourself or give them to someone else to use, but if you purchase multiple Vouchers for the purpose of reselling them, we may restrict you from purchasing future offers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>All Vouchers are sold to you by the applicable participating merchant Ð we simply act as a sales channel of the merchant by making Deals available to you.&nbsp; The merchant, and not ClickedIn.com, is the issuer of the Voucher.&nbsp; By placing an order to purchase a Deal from a merchant through our site, you make an offer to purchase such Deal on the terms and conditions set forth along with the Deal and in these Terms of Use.&nbsp; By purchasing a Deal, you acquire the right to print a Voucher issued by the participating merchant and to use the Voucher according to its terms and these Terms of Use. Whether you choose to print and/or redeem the Voucher is within your sole control and at your sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>General Restrictions and Limitations</strong></p>
<p>Each Deal has specific terms associated with it, and those terms will be presented to you at the time you offer to purchase the Deal.&nbsp; In the event of a conflict between the Deal-specific terms presented to you at the time of purchase, and the terms set forth in these Terms of Use, the Deal-specific terms will control except to the extent they are prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<p>Opportunities to purchase Deals, and to redeem the associated Vouchers, are available for a limited time only.&nbsp; The deadline for your purchase will be indicated on our site, and the expiration date of a Voucher will be indicated on the Voucher itself.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While the expiration date on a Voucher dictates the last date that you can use the Voucher, applicable law may provide that the participating merchant is responsible for honoring the paid portion of the Voucher for a period of time beyond the expiration date.&nbsp; For example, if you paid $20 for a Voucher that gives you $50 of value to spend at the participating merchant, the merchant may be required by law to allow you to redeem the Voucher at a value of $20 (which is the paid portion of the Voucher) even after the stated expiration date has passed.&nbsp; If you have an expired Voucher and would like to redeem it for the price you paid to acquire it, please contact the applicable merchant. If you have contacted the merchant and the merchant has refused to allow you to redeem the paid value of your expired Voucher, and if applicable law entitles you to such redemption, please contact us by mail or email and explain your situation and we will provide you with cash or a site credit equal to the unused paid portion of the Voucher.</p>
<p>Vouchers are redeemable in their entirety and on a one time basis only, and may not be redeemed incrementally, unless otherwise required by applicable law. If you redeem a Voucher for less than its paid value, you may be entitled under applicable law to a credit or cash from the participating merchant equal to the difference between the paid value and the amount redeemed, depending on the laws of your jurisdiction.&nbsp; If you redeem a Voucher for more than the paid value but less than the face value (i.e. the paid value and promotional portion), then you will only be entitled to a credit or cash from the merchant if required by applicable law.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Vouchers cannot be combined with other offers unless otherwise specified by the participating merchant.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For Florida residents purchasing Deals where the merchant is a healthcare provider: the patient and any other person responsible for payment has a right to refuse to pay, cancel payment or be reimbursed for payment for any service, examination or treatment that is performed as a result of and within 72 hours of responding to the advertisement for the free, discounted fee or reduced fee service, examination or treatment.&nbsp; In most states, businesses not exclusively owned by physicians are prohibited from practicing medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Terms Specific to Restaurant Vouchers&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>For Vouchers that are redeemable at restaurants: (i) redemption frequency is determined by the restaurant; (ii) use of the Vouchers for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the restaurant and is subject to compliance with applicable law; (iii) the Vouchers cannot be used for taxes, tips or prior balances, unless permitted by the restaurant; and (iv) the Vouchers are valid for dine-in only unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p><strong>Terms Specific to Non-Restaurant Vouchers</strong></p>
<p>For Vouchers that are redeemable at merchants other than restaurants: (i) the Vouchers may be applied only to merchandise sold by the participating merchant, and may not be applied to shipping or handling charges; (ii) only one Voucher may be used per visit / per redemption unless otherwise specified by participating merchant. </p>
<p><strong>Lost or Stolen Vouchers</strong></p>
<p>Neither we nor any participating merchant will be responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers.</p>
<p><strong>Fraudulent Use Prohibited</strong></p>
<p>Reproduction, sale or trade of a Voucher is prohibited unless done in compliance with applicable law.&nbsp; If you attempt to redeem a Voucher in violation of its terms or these Terms of Use, it will be rendered null and void to the extent permitted by law. We and the participating merchants who offer Vouchers on this site reserve the right to take action against and seek damages from any individual who engages in counterfeiting or other fraudulent use of Deals or Vouchers, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>In some cases a Deal may contain a restriction that prohibits you from making multiple purchases of the same Deal.&nbsp; If you attempt to purchase more than the permitted number by using multiple or different identities, payment forms or other means, your purchase will be void.&nbsp; We will determine in our sole discretion whether purchase characteristics indicate a violation of such restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>ClickedIn Cash</strong></p>
<p>We may offer you free promotional credits (&ldquo;ClickedIn Cash&rdquo;) that you can use to purchase Vouchers on our site.&nbsp; In some cases, we will issue ClickedIn Cash to you when you do certain things, such as refer your friends to us.&nbsp; Your ClickedIn Cash will expire 36 months after it is issued to you, unless a different expiration period is stated when the ClickedIn Cash is offered or issued to you, and except as otherwise required by applicable law.&nbsp; To find out how much ClickedIn Cash is in your account, log into the &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; section on the ClickedIn homepage and check your account information.&nbsp; ClickedIn Cash is not transferrable.&nbsp; ClickedIn Cash can not be redeemed for cash, and you will lose your ClickedIn Cash if your account is terminated or we discontinue making Deals available.</p>

<p><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unless you opt out, you are agreeing to resolve certain disputes through arbitration.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>THE BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE BELOW SAYS THAT YOU AND US AGREE TO RESOLVE CERTAIN DISPUTES THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS PART OF THESE TERMS OF USE.&nbsp; PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND OUR BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF IT. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Our goal is to resolve Disputes fairly and quickly.&nbsp; (A &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and us regarding any aspect of your relationship with us.)&nbsp; However, if we cannot resolve a Dispute with you, then, except as described elsewhere below, each of us agrees to submit the Dispute to the American Arbitration Association for resolution under its Commercial Arbitration Rules or, by separate mutual agreement, to another arbitration institution.&nbsp; As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local &ldquo;small claims&rdquo; court, if its rules permit it. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>You may bring claims only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of any official or other person, or any class of people. Only claims for money damages may be submitted to arbitration; claims for injunctive orders or similar relief must be brought in a court.&nbsp; You may not combine a claim that is subject to arbitration under these terms and conditions with a claim that is not eligible for arbitration under these terms and conditions.&nbsp; The arbitrator will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The arbitrator will issue an award decision in writing but will not provide an explanation for the award unless you or we request one.&nbsp; Any arbitration award over $75,000 may be appealed to a three-person panel appointed by the same arbitration institution that rendered the original award.&nbsp; Any such appeal must be filed within 30 days and the appeal will be decided, based on that institution&rsquo;s appeal rules, within 120 days of filing.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Before you initiate an arbitration proceeding, you may request that we advance on your behalf (1) the arbitration filing fees (but only to the extent they exceed your local small claims court filing fees) and (2) the portion of the arbitrator&rsquo;s costs for which you would normally be responsible.&nbsp; If we win the arbitration, you will reimburse us for these advances.&nbsp; We will, of course, pay any fees or costs required under the law where you live.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>You may opt out of this arbitration provision.&nbsp; If you do so, neither you nor we can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.&nbsp; To opt out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.&nbsp; You must use one of these addresses to opt out:</li>
