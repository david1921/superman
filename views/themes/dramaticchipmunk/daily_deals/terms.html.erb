Neither Analog Analytics nor any third-party provider of information guarantees the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any content, nor its merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose. (Refer to Section 6 above for the complete provisions governing limitation of liabilities and disclaimers of warranty.)<br><br>

In many instances, the content available through this Site represents the opinions and judgments of the respective information provider, end user, or other user not under contract with Analog Analytics.

Under no circumstances will Analog Analytics be liable for any loss or damage caused by an end user&#39;s reliance on information obtained through Analog Analytics. It is the responsibility of End User to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice, etc., or other content available through Analog Analytics.<br><br>

Analog Analytics contains links to third party Web sites maintained by other content providers.

Unless you have executed a written agreement with Analog Analytics expressly permitting you to do so, you may not provide a hyperlink to the Site from any other website. Analog Analytics reserves the right to revoke its consent to any link at any time in its sole discretion.
If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: &quot;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&quot;</p><br>

The Merchant is the issuer of the Voucher and is fully responsible for all goods and services it provides to you and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs (“Liabilities”) it may cause you to suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or in part, whether related to the use or redemption of a Voucher or not. You waive and release Analog Analytics and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, publishers, advertisers, business partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from any Liabilities arising from or related to any act or omission of a Merchant in connection with your use of a Voucher or the services/goods it provides in connection with it.<br><br>

Vouchers purchased on the Site by you as a Analog Analytics account holder, are special promotional offers that you purchase from participating Merchants through our service. The Vouchers are redeemable for certain goods, services or experiences offered by, or facilitated through, the Merchant identified on the Voucher. The Merchant is solely responsible for redeeming the Voucher. By placing an order for a Voucher, you make an offer to purchase the Voucher you have selected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the terms on the Voucher itself and any additional, deal specific terms advertising the Voucher at the time of purchase (the “Fine Print”). In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Fine Print, the Fine Print will govern.<br><br>

There are two separate parts to each Voucher: (a) the purchase value and (b) the promotional value. Together the purchase value and the promotional value add up to the full offer value of the Voucher and appears in the upper right hand corner of the Voucher Voucher. The purchase value is the amount you pay to buy a Voucher. The purchase value does not expire until it is used or refunded. The promotional value is the “added” value of the Voucher – the amount in excess of the purchase value. The promotional value will expire by the date stated on the face of the Voucher unless applicable law prohibits the promotional value from expiring. For example, if you pay $20 for a Voucher that gets you $50 of goods or services from a Merchant, the full offer value is $50, the purchase value is $20 (and that amount dos not expire until it is used or is refunded), and the promotional value is $30 and it expires on the date stated on the Voucher (unless expiration of the promotional value is prohibited by law). </p><br>
