<strong><br clear="all" />
</strong>
<p><strong>II. TERMS OF SALE</strong><br />
  By placing an order, you make an offer to Analog Analytics or any of our publishers, advertisers or other third party customers and vendors to purchase the Vouchers you have selected on the terms and conditions stated below. For more information, please view the Analog Analytics Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>You are required to create an account in order to purchase any product. This is required so we can provide you with easy access to print your orders, view your past purchases, modify your preferences, and to ensure permissible use of the product. </p>
<p>Vouchers you purchase are redeemable for goods or services provided by a Merchant . The Merchant, not Analog Analytics nor NJMG, is the seller of the goods and services. Merchant is solely responsible for redeeming any Analog Analytics Voucher that you purchase. Analog Analytics, through its publishers, advertisers or other third party customers and vendors, sells a Voucher that can be redeemed in connection with your purchase of the goods or services from Merchant. <br />
  <strong>1. Terms and Conditions for Restaurant-Specific Vouchers</strong><br />
  For this section, &ldquo;Restaurant&rdquo; shall be defined as a Merchant that offers food and beverage for sale in its regular business operations, and is making such food and beverages available to purchasers of Analog Analytics Vouchers. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Redemption frequency is determined by Restaurants, and shall be contained in the Voucher offer. </li>
  <li>Use of Restaurant-Specific Vouchers for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant. Restaurant agrees to comply with all state laws pertaining to the same. </li>
  <li>It is at the discretion of the Restaurant to determine whether Analog Analytics Vouchers can be combined with any other restaurant vouchers, third party certificates, coupons, or promotions. </li>
  <li>Restaurant-Specific Vouchers cannot be used for taxes, tips or prior balances, unless permitted by the Restaurant. </li>
  <li>Vouchers are valid for dine-in only unless otherwise stated. </li>
  <li>The issuing of restaurant credit is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant unless otherwise required by law. </li>
  <li>Neither Analog Analytics, NJMG, nor the Restaurant is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers or Restaurant Voucher reference numbers. </li>
  <li>Reproduction, sale or trade of Restaurant-Specific Vouchers is prohibited unless done so in compliance with the law. </li>
  <li>Any attempted redemption not consistent with the terms &amp; conditions of the Restaurant-Specific Voucher will render the Restaurant-Specific Voucher void. </li>
  <li>Void to the extent prohibited by law. </li>
  <li>The Voucher offer (including, but not limited to, any discounts) expires on the date specified on the Voucher, except that the Restaurant may continue to redeem the unused cash value you paid for the Voucher (which is usually less than the original face value of the Voucher) to the extent required by applicable law. See Section 3 below for a more detailed explanation. </li>
  <li>If you redeem the Voucher for less than its face value, you will not be entitled to a credit, cash or new Voucher equal to the difference between the face value and the amount you redeemed, unless otherwise required by law. You will only be entitled to a continuing redemption value if the amount that you paid for the Voucher exceeds the amount you redeemed. For example, if you paid $20 for a voucher which entitles you to purchase $50 of product by June 30, 2010 and you make a purchase for $40 on June 1, 2010, you will not be entitled to a credit or cash equal to the difference between the $50 face value and the amount you redeemed. You will not have any redemption value either because the amount you redeemed is more than what you paid for the Voucher. </li>
  <li>All purchases of Restaurant-Specific Vouchers may have statutory limitations on the amount of the Voucher value that can be redeemed for alcoholic beverages. For example, for customers purchasing Vouchers for Restaurants in Ohio, the redemption of the Voucher may be subject to the limitations imposed by the Ohio Revised Code Title [43] XLIII, Section 4301.01, which imposes a limitation of redeeming Vouchers at Restaurants that serve both food and alcoholic and intoxicating liquor beverages, such that the redemption of such Voucher can only be applied to alcoholic and intoxicating liquor beverages for up to 30% of the value of the Voucher. Compliance with state statutes or codes (for example, the Ohio Revised Code) is the responsibility of the Merchant. Analog Analytics&rsquo; and NJMG&rsquo;s sole roles in the transaction are as&nbsp; marketing agents for the Restaurant-Specific Voucher, and the applicability and compliance with any relevant statute or code is solely determined and consummated by the Restaurant. Neither Analog Analytics nor NJMG has any role in such determination or action on the part of the Merchant.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Terms and Conditions for Non-Restaurant Merchant Vouchers</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Redemption frequency is determined by Merchants, and shall be contained in the Voucher offer.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>A Merchant Voucher may be applied only to merchandise sold by Merchant, and may not be applied to shipping or handling charges. </li>
  <li>Limit one (1) voucher per redemption. Only one voucher can be used per order unless otherwise specified by Merchant. </li>
  <li>The issuing of credit is at the sole discretion of the merchant unless otherwise required by law.</li>
  <li>Neither NJMG, nor the Merchant is responsible for any lost or stolen Voucher or Voucher reference number. </li>
  <li>A Voucher cannot be combined with any other Vouchers, third party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by Merchant. </li>
  <li>Reproduction, sale or trade of any Voucher is prohibited unless done so in compliance with the law. </li>
  <li>Any attempted redemption not consistent with the terms and conditions of the Voucher will render the Voucher null and void. </li>
  <li>Void to the extent prohibited by law. </li>
  <li>The Voucher offer (including, but not limited to, any discounts) expires on the date specified on the Analog Analytics Voucher, except that the Merchant may continue to redeem the unused cash amount you paid for the Voucher (which is usually less than the original face value of the Voucher) to the extent required by applicable law. See section 3 for a more detailed explanation.</li>
  <li>If you redeem the Voucher for less than its face value, you will not be entitled to a credit, cash or a new Voucher equal to the difference between the face value and the amount you redeemed, unless otherwise required by law. You will only be entitled to a continuing redemption value if the amount that you paid for the Voucher exceeds the amount you redeemed. For example, if you paid $20 for a Voucher which entitles you to purchase $50 of product by June 30, 2010 and you make a purchase for $40 on June 1, 2010, you will not be entitled to a credit or cash equal to the difference between the $50 face value and the amount you redeemed. You will not have any redemption value either because the amount you redeemed is more than what you paid for the Voucher. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Additional Terms and Conditions for All Analog Analytics Products</strong><br />
  All Vouchers printed from the Analog Analytics website or any website associated with Analog Analytics, including any of our publishers, advertisers or other third party customers and vendors, &nbsp;Site are promotional vouchers that are offered to customers below their face value and shall be subject to these Terms of Use and the applicable Merchant&rsquo;s restrictions. The Merchant is the seller of the goods or services which you are purchasing.</p>
The holder and issuer of a Restaurant-Specific Voucher is the restaurant. The holder and issuer of a Merchant Voucher is the Merchant. As a holder and issuer of the Vouchers, the Restaurant or merchant shall be fully responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the restaurant or the Merchant, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed Vouchers. Restaurant-Specific Vouchers and Merchant Vouchers are redeemable in their entirety only and may not be redeemed incrementally.&nbsp; According to the laws of the respective states in which you purchased your Analog Analytics&rsquo; voucher, and in which you wish to redeem your Analog Analytics&rsquo; voucher at the Merchant, the Merchant is responsible for allowing you to redeem your Analog Analytics&rsquo; voucher for the cash value based on the money you actually paid for your Analog Analytics&rsquo; voucher (i.e. if you paid $20 for a Analog Analytics&rsquo; voucher which gives you $50 of value to the Merchant, the cash value that you paid is $20, not $50), for a period of time that may extend beyond the expiration date on the voucher.While the expiration date on the Voucher dictates the last date that you can redeem your Voucher with the Merchant for the promotional offer which is stated on the Voucher, state laws (which vary state-by-state, and which are generally made available by each state on the web) may provide that the Merchant is responsible for honoring the cash value that you paid for your Voucher for a period of time beyond the expiration date stated on the Voucher. If applicable, this is a statutory provision which applies to the Merchant, and it is the sole responsibility of the Merchant (and in no way the responsibility of Analog Analytics or NJMG, as neither Analog Analytics nor NJMG is the Merchant, has no obligations of the Merchant, or is performing any function other than selling the promotional Voucher on behalf of the Merchant) to comply with such applicable laws and statutes which may govern the Merchant.
