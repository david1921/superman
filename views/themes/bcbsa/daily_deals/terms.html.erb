<h4>
<p>Welcome to Blue365deals.com. This is a summary of the applicable Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (<b>“BCBSA,” “we”</b> or <b>“our”</b>) terms, conditions, and privacy policy for the Blue365deals.com site (<b>“Site”</b>). For our complete terms and conditions, please read below and visit our <%= daily_deals_privacy_link(@publisher) %>, <%= link_to "Member Authorization and Email Authorization", new_publisher_consumer_path(@publisher) %>. Your privacy is important to us and we will protect it. We will not share your personal information with anyone other than in accordance with our Privacy Policy, Member Authorization and Email Authorization. </p>


<p>Your use of the Site may involve the opportunity for you to purchase special deals (“<b>Blue365Deals</b>,” as described below) for the products and services of third party vendors and suppliers (<b>“Blue365 Vendors”</b>). As a condition of purchase, we require your permission to send you administrative and promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity and purchases, as well as updates about these products, services, and promotional offers. You can opt-out of our promotional emails anytime by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our email correspondences. By placing an order with respect to a specific Blue365 Deal, you make an offer to purchase products or services you have selected based on standard restrictions, Blue365 Vendor-specific restrictions, the terms and conditions stated below, and applicable law.</p>

<p>You are required to create an account in order to purchase any product or service from the Site. This is required so we can provide you with easy access to print your orders, view your past purchases, modify your preferences, and comply with applicable law. Neither BCBSA nor any of its independent, local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Companies (each a <b>“Blue Company”</b> and collectively, <b>“Blue Companies”</b>), nor any of its or their affiliates, contractors or consultants, and other third parties (collectively, <b>“BCBSA Group”</b>) involved with creating, managing, operating. or otherwise assisting with the Site take any responsibility for the products or services for which vouchers (hereinafter <b>“Vouchers”</b>) may be redeemed or coupons (hereafter <b>“Coupons”</b>) used.</p>

<p>As part of or in connection with creating your account and accessing Blue365 Deals and other material on the Site, you have authorized the BCBSA Group to share your Blue365 user information details (including your name, email address, and other information) with your Blue Company as well as with Blue365 Vendors and you may have authorized BCBSA, your local Blue Company and others of the BCBSA Group to send you emails and forward your emails and attachments to others of the BCBSA Group, as well as to Blue365 Vendors who provide the products and services involved with the Vouchers and Coupons, all so that they can communicate directly to you and assist you with your purchases and other promotional matters. Information that you provide to us on this website is not protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 CFR Part 164.  Those authorizations are voluntary. Your access to and use of the Site is conditioned on such authorizations. You may change your user profile, opt out of email, or revoke those authorizations at any time by sending your request in writing specifying what you want to do to the following address: <b>Blue365 Member Services, 225 North Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL, 60601-7680,</b> or alternatively, you may send it via email to: <a href="mailto:support@Blue365deals.com">support@Blue365deals.com</a>. Your revocation will not affect any use or disclosure of the information in your e-mail by any of the BCBSA Group prior to BCBSA's receipt of the revocation and its response to you confirming such revocation. </p>

<p>None of the BCBSA Group make any warranty to users (<b>“End Users”</b>) of the Site for the quality, safety, usability, or other aspect of any product or service for which the Voucher is redeemed or a Coupon used. All End Users are members (<b>“Member(s)”</b>) of a Blue Company which has chosen to participate in the Blue365 Program. Some services for which Vouchers can be redeemed or Coupons used are activities that involve potential bodily harm, and for those activities, none of the BCBSA Group takes any responsibility for the service or activity being offered, and the End User takes responsibility for his or her own actions in utilizing the services or products for which the Vouchers can be redeemed or a Coupon used. See Section 6, below, for more information on this limitation of liability. The Voucher you purchase is redeemable for products or services by the Blue365 Vendor of such products and services, and is subject to the applicable Terms of Use and any other Blue365 Vendor conditions. The individual Blue365 Vendor, not any of the BCBSA Group, is the only provider of its corresponding products and services. If you have any questions about these terms, please contact BCBSA at <a href="mailto:support@Blue365deals.com">support@Blue365deals.com</a>. To read the complete Terms of Use, please see below.</p>

By using the Site (other than to read this Agreement for the first time), End User agrees to comply with all of the terms and conditions hereof. The right to use the Site is personal to End-User and is not transferable to any other person or entity. End User shall be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of End User’s password(s), if any. End User acknowledges that, although the Internet is often a secure environment, sometimes there are interruptions in service or events that are beyond the control of the BCBSA Group, and none of the BCBSA Group shall be responsible for any data lost while transmitting information on the Internet or your use of the Site. While it is the objective of the BCBSA Group to make the Site accessible 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, the Site may be unavailable from time to time for any reason including, without limitation, routine maintenance. You understand and acknowledge that due to circumstances both within and outside of the control of the BCBSA Group, access to the Site may be interrupted, suspended, or terminated from time to time.

<b><p>3. <u>Modified Terms.</u></b>  BCBSA reserves the right at all times to discontinue or modify any of these Terms of Use and/or the Privacy Policy as it deems necessary or desirable without prior notification to you. Such changes may include, among other things, the adding of certain fees or charges.

If we make changes to these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and you continue to use the Site, you are impliedly agreeing to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy expressed herein. Any such deletions or modifications shall be effective immediately upon BCBSA’s posting thereof. Any use of any of the Site by End User after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by End User of such modifications.</p>

<b><p>4.  <u>Arbitration; Applicable Law.</u></b>  By using the Site, End User agrees that any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use and/or the Privacy Policy or the performance, breach, or termination thereof, or the Site or any Third Party Site, or any products or services provided under or through the Site, shall be finally settled by arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, under the rules of arbitration of the American Arbitration Association. These Terms of Use and legal issues arising out of, but not exclusive to the use of, the Site or any Third Party Sites (as defined in Section 8 below) (unless otherwise specifically stated) are governed by and in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois (exclusive of its rules regarding conflicts of laws). The Site is controlled and operated by certain entities of the BCBSA Group from offices located within the United States. The BCBSA Group makes no representation that materials in the Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where their contents are illegal is prohibited.

YOU AND BCBSA AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE OR YOUR USE HEREOF MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>

<b><p>5.  <u>Class Action Waiver.</u></b>  ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. </p>
	
<b><p>6. <u>Disclaimer of Warranty; Limitation of Liability.</u></b></p>
	
<p>The Site offers access to savings on health and wellness products and services and other interesting items that Members may purchase from independent vendors, which are different from covered benefits under your policies with your local Blue Company, its contracts with Medicare, or any other applicable federal healthcare program. </p>

Section 1101 et seq. (<b>“ERISA”</b>).</p>

<p>END USER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF THE SITE AND THE THIRD PARTY SITES IS AT END USER’S SOLE RISK. NEITHER ANY OF THE BCBSA GROUP NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS, OR LICENSORS WARRANT THAT USE OF THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE; NOR DO THEY MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO (A) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SITE, OR (B) THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR CONTENT OF ANY INFORMATION, SERVICE, OR MERCHANDISE PROVIDED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR THE THIRD PARTY SITES.

Further, the BCBSA Group is free to use any and/or none of the ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, and suggestions contained in any communications you send to the Site for any purpose whatever, including but not limited to creating and marketing products and/or services using such information. The BCBSA Group is not responsible and shall not be liable for content posted to the Site by visitors or persons other than BCBSA employees. Opinions or comments contained in content reflect the views of the author and not of the BCBSA Group, unless BCBSA expressly states the contrary.</p>

<p>By submitting communications or other material to any public area of the Site, End User warrants that the owner of such communications or other material has expressly granted the BCBSA Group the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, redistribute, transmit, perform, and display such material (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in such material. End User also permits any other end user to access, view, store, or reproduce the communications or other material for that end user’s personal use. End User hereby grants the BCBSA Group the right to edit, copy, publish, and distribute any communications or other material made available on the Site by End User. The foregoing provisions of <u>Section 10</u> apply equally to and are for the benefit of each of the BCBSA Group and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf.</p>

<b><p>11. <u>Monitoring.</u></b>  BCBSA directly or indirectly through others of the BCBSA Group shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the content of the Site at all times, including any chat rooms and forums that may hereinafter be included as part of the Site, to determine compliance with this Agreement and any operating rules established by any of the BCBSA Group, as well as to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, or authorized government request. Without limiting the foregoing, BCBSA directly or indirectly through others of the BCBSA Group shall have the right to remove any material that BCBSA, in its sole discretion, finds to be in violation of the provisions hereof or otherwise objectionable. </p>

<b><p>12. <u>Privacy.</u></b>  End User acknowledges that all discussion for ratings, comments, bulletin board service, chat rooms, and/or other message or communication facilities (collectively <b>“Group(s)s”</b>) are public and not private communications, and that, therefore, others may read End User’s communications without End User’s knowledge. The BCBSA Group does not control or endorse the content, messages, or information found in any Group, and, therefore, the BCBSA Group specifically disclaims any liability concerning the Groups and any actions resulting from End Users participation in any Group, including any objectionable content. Generally, any communication which End User posts to any part of the Site (whether in chat rooms, discussion groups, message boards, or otherwise) is considered to be non-confidential. If particular web pages permit the submission of communications that will be treated by any of the BCBSA Group as confidential, that fact will be stated on those pages. By posting comments, messages, or other information on the Site, End User grants each of the BCBSA Group the right to use such comments, messages, or information for promotions, advertising, market research, or any other lawful purpose. For more information, see our <%= daily_deals_privacy_link(@publisher) %></p>

<b><p>13. <u>Indemnification.</u></b> End User agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each of the BCBSA Group (including BCBSA) and its and their affiliates and respective directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, cost or debt, and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from (a) End User’s use of and access to the Site and/or the Third Party Sites, (b) End User’s violation of any provisions of this Agreement, (c) End User’s violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right, or (d) any claim that any content or information submitted by End User causes damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation specifically will survive this Agreement and your use of the Site.<p>

<b><p>14.  <u>Reservation of Rights and Release.</u></b> BCBSA reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or take any action BCBSA deems appropriate regarding disputes that End User may have with other customers of ours or with any Blue365 Vendor. To the extent the law permits, End User releases each of the BCBSA Group from any claims or liability related to any content or other information posted on the Site and from any claims related to the conduct of any other customers or other End Users or Vendors. You hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542 (if you are a California resident), and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction (if you are a resident of such jurisdiction), which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>

<b><p>15. <u>Termination.</u></b>  BCBSA may terminate this Agreement at any time. Without limiting the foregoing, any of the BCBSA Group shall have the right to immediately terminate any passwords or accounts of End User in the event of any conduct by End User which any of the BCBSA Group, in its sole discretion, considers to be unacceptable, or in the event of any breach by End User of this Agreement.

Accordingly, BCBSA and the others of the BCBSA Group have no more editorial control over such content than does a public library, bookstore, or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by individual Blue365 Vendors and other third parties, including information providers or any other end users are those of the respective author(s) or distributors, and not of any of the BCBSA Group.

Under no circumstances will any of the BCBSA Group be liable for any loss or damage caused by an End User’s reliance on information obtained through the Site.

These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by any of the BCBSA Group of the contents on such individual Blue365 Vendor and other Third-Party Sites and the BCBSA Group hereby expressly disclaims any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such individual Blue365 Vendors and Third-Party Sites. If End User decides to access linked individual Blue365 Vendor and other Third-Party Sites, End User does so at its own risk. None of the BCBSA Group controls, endorses, promotes, or has any affiliation with any other website unless expressly stated in the Site. Unless you have executed a written agreement with BCBSA expressly permitting you to do so, you may not provide a hyperlink to the Site from any other site. BCBSA reserves the right to revoke its consent to any link at any time in its sole discretion.</p>

The Site may contain information and press releases about any of the BCBSA Group, and although this information was believed to be accurate as of the date prepared, the BCBSA Group disclaims any duty or obligation to update such information. To the extent that any information is deemed to be a "forward looking statement" as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, such information is intended to fit within the "safe harbor" for forward looking information and is subject to material risk factors which may or may not be disclosed herein.</p>

<b><p>21.  <u>Blue365 Rewards.</u></b>  Through the use of the Site, End User may accumulate Blue365 Rewards, as defined below. A Member of a Blue Company that participates in the Blue365 Program and who is an End User on this Site (<b>“Referring Member”</b>) and who refers another Member of a Blue Company that participates in the Blue365 Program (<b>“Referred Member”</b>) to register as an end user on the Site is eligible to be granted Blue365 Rewards, subject to the terms and conditions described herein. The first time that a Referred Member who becomes an End User purchases a Blue365 Deal on the Blue365deals.com Site (note that the Blue365 Deal must be purchased on the Blue365deals.com site and not on a Blue365 Vendor’s website), the Referring Member shall receive one $10 Reward credit (<b>“Blue365 Reward(s)”</b>). If the Referred Member’s purchase is cancelled, returned or otherwise rescinded, the applicable Reward shall also be cancelled and rescinded. To effect the referral, the Referring Member shall provide a referral link contained on the Blue365deals.com Site to each proposed Referred Member. If the proposed Referred Member clicks on such link and then registers to be an End User with Blue365deals.com within 72 hours, such Member becomes a Referred Member for purposes of a Reward to the Referring Member. However, the Reward is not issued to the Referring Member until a few days after the Referred Member completes his or her first purchase on the Blue365deals.com Site. Referring Members will only receive one $10 Reward credit for each new Referred Member, but there is no limit to the number of referrals a Referring Member may make. Once a Referring Member is awarded Blue365 Rewards (which may take a few days after the Referred Member makes his or her first purchase on the Blue365deals.com Site), such Blue365 Rewards will automatically be applied against amounts the Referring Member may owe for a subsequent purchase on the Blue365deals.com Site (but not on sites of Blue365 Vendors). Blue365 Rewards have no Cash Value (defined and described further below in Part II, Terms of Sale) and are subject to these Terms of Use and applicable law.	Blue365 Rewards are not returnable or refundable for cash, except where required by law. Resale of Blue365 Rewards is strictly prohibited. This Blue365 Rewards program may be modified or terminated at anytime at BCBSA’s option and discretion, but except as specifically stated above, Blue365 Rewards previously granted do not expire.</p>

<h4>II. TERMS OF SALE</h4>

<p>By placing an Order, you make an offer to the BCBSA Group to purchase the Vouchers or to obtain a Coupon you have selected on the terms and conditions stated below and above, and applicable law. For more information, please view our <%= daily_deals_privacy_link(@publisher) %>, <%= link_to "Member Authorization and Email Authorization", new_publisher_consumer_path(@publisher) %>.  You are required to create an account in order to purchase any Voucher or obtain a Coupon. Vouchers you purchase are redeemable for products or services by the Blue365 Vendor of such products and/or services, and Coupons may be used with respect to products or services from the Blue365 Vendor of such products and services. The Blue365 Vendor, not BCBSA nor any of the BCBSA Group, is the provider of the products and services and is solely responsible for redeeming any Voucher that you purchase or Coupon you obtain. Each Blue365 Deal has specific terms associated with the Blue365 Deal, which will be presented to you at the time you commit to purchase the particular Blue365 Deal. Deal specific terms supersede any inconsistent terms in this Agreement, except to the extent such terms are prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<b><p>1. <u>Terms and Conditions for Restaurant-Specific Vouchers or Coupons.</u></b>  For this section, <b>“Restaurant”</b> shall be defined as a Blue365 Vendor who offers food and beverage for sale in its regular business operations, and is making such food and beverages available to purchasers of Vouchers or users of Coupons. Redemption frequency and the use of any Coupons is determined by the specific Restaurant, and shall be contained in the Voucher or Coupon offer and is subject to applicable law. Use of Restaurant-Specific Vouchers or Coupons for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant. Restaurant shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws. It is at the discretion of the Restaurant to determine whether these Vouchers or Coupons can be combined with any other Restaurant vouchers, third party certificates, other coupons or promotions. Restaurant-Specific Vouchers cannot be used for taxes, tips, or prior balances, unless permitted by the Restaurant. Valid for dine in only unless otherwise stated. The issuing of Restaurant credit is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant unless otherwise required by law. Neither any of the BCBSA Group nor the Restaurant is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers or Coupons or Restaurant Voucher or Coupon reference numbers. Reproduction, sale, or trade of a Restaurant-Specific Voucher or Coupon is prohibited unless done so in compliance with the law. These Terms of Use and/or Voucher and Coupon details are valid to the extent permitted by law, and void to the extent prohibited by law. Any attempted redemption not consistent with these terms and conditions will render the Restaurant-Specific Voucher or Coupon void. The offer (including, but not limited to, any discounts) expires on the date specified on the Voucher or Coupon, except that the Restaurant may continue to redeem the unused cash value (<b>“Cash Value”</b>) paid by an End User for the Voucher (which is usually less than the original face value (<b>“Face Value”</b>) of the Voucher) to the extent required by applicable law. See Section 3 below for a more detailed explanation. All purchases of Vouchers for Restaurants may have statutory limitations on the amount of the Voucher Face Value that can be redeemed for alcoholic beverages. For example, for Members purchasing Vouchers for Restaurants in Ohio, the redemption of the Voucher may be subject to the limitations imposed by the Ohio Revised Code Title [43] XLIII, Section 4301.01, which imposes a limitation of redeeming Vouchers at restaurants that serve both food and alcoholic and intoxicating liquor beverages, such that the redemption of such Voucher can only be applied to alcoholic and intoxicating liquor beverages for up to 30% of the Face Value of the Voucher. Compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes or codes (for example, the Ohio Revised Code) is the responsibility of the Restaurant. The BCBSA Group’s sole role in the transaction is as a marketing agent for the Restaurant Voucher, and the applicability and compliance with any relevant statute or code is solely determined and consummated by the Restaurant, and the BCBSA Group has no role in such determination or action on the part of the Restaurant. </p>

<b><p>2. <u>Terms and Conditions for Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor Vouchers.</u></b>  Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor Vouchers may be applied only to products and services sold by Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendors, and may not be applied to shipping or handling charges. Limit one (1) Voucher per order unless otherwise specified by Non- Restaurant suppliers or applicable law. The issuing of credit is at the sole discretion of the Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor unless otherwise required by law. Neither any of the BCBSA Group nor the Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor is responsible for any lost or stolen Voucher or Voucher reference number or Coupon or Coupon reference number. Voucher cannot be combined with any other vouchers, third party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor or applicable law. These Terms of Use and/or Voucher and Coupon details are valid to the extent permitted by law, and void to the extent prohibited by law. Reproduction, sale, or trade of this Voucher is prohibited unless done so in compliance with applicable law and applicable Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor terms and conditions. Any attempted redemption not consistent with these terms and conditions will render the Voucher null and void. The Voucher offer (including, but not limited to, any discounts) expires on the date specified on the Voucher, except that the Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor may continue to redeem the unused Cash Value paid for the Voucher (which is usually less than the original Face Value of the Voucher) to the extent required by applicable law. See Section 3 for a more detailed explanation.  </p>

<b><p>3. <u>Additional Terms and Conditions. </u></b></p>

<p>All Vouchers printed from the Site or any website associated with any of the BCBSA Group, including any of our publishers, advertisers, or other third party customers and Blue365 Vendors, are promotional Vouchers that are offered to End Users below their Face Value and shall be subject to these Terms of Use, terms, and conditions of the participating Restaurant or Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor and applicable law. </p>

<p>The Blue365 Supplier is the provider of the products or services which you are purchasing. THE HOLDER AND ISSUER OF A RESTAURANT-SPECIFIC VOUCHER IS THE RESTAURANT. THE HOLDER AND ISSUER OF A NON-RESTARANT SUPPLIER VOUCHER IS THE NON-RESTAURANT VENDOR. AS A HOLDER AND ISSUER OF THE VOUCHER, THE RESTAURANT OR THE NON-RESTAURANT SUPPLIER SHALL BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AND ALL INJURIES, ILLNESSES, DAMAGES, CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, AND COSTS SUFFERED BY OR IN RESPECT TO A CUSTOMER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE RESTAURANT OR THE NON-RESTAURANT VENDOR, AS WELL AS FOR ANY UNCLAIMED PROPERTY LIABILITY ARISING FROM UNREDEEMED VOUCHERS. RESTAURANT-SPECIFIC VOUCHERS, AND NON-RESTAURANT SUPPLIER VOUCHERS ARE REDEEMABLE IN THEIR ENTIRETY ONLY AND MAY NOT BE REDEEMED INCREMENTALLY (i.e., no credit balance will carry over for any unused balance), UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED BY THE APPLICABLE RESTAURANT OR NON-RESTAURANT SUPPLIER.  </p>

<p>Notice: The <b>“Expiration Date”</b> on the Voucher dictates the last date that you can use your Voucher at Blue365 Vendor for the promotional offer which is stated on the Voucher. Federal, state, and local laws (which vary and which are generally made available by each State and local governmental unit on the web) may provide that the Blue365 Vendor is responsible for honoring the Cash Value that you paid for your Voucher for a certain period of time beyond the Expiration Date stated on the Voucher. If applicable, this is a statutory provision which applies to that particular Blue365 Vendor, and it is the sole responsibility of that Blue365 Vendor (and in no way the responsibility of any of the BCBSA Group or any third party publisher, as the BCBSA Group is not the Blue365 Vendor, has no obligations of the Blue365 Vendor and is merely selling the promotional Voucher on behalf of the Blue365 Vendor) to comply with such applicable laws and statutes which may govern the Blue365 Vendor.  </p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated at the time a Voucher is purchased, the Voucher price does not include sales, value added, or use taxes, which may be charged to you separately by the Blue365 Vendor at the time you redeem the Voucher.</p>

<p>In the event you redeem your Voucher for less than the full Face Value of the Voucher, your purchase will be allocated first against the Cash Value you paid for the Voucher until the Cash value is reduced to zero dollars ($0.00), and then against the remainder of the Face Value. According to the laws of the respective states and local governmental units in which you purchased your Voucher, and in which you wish to use your Voucher at the Blue365 Vendor, the Blue365 Vendor (but only that Blue365 Vendor and not any of the BCBSA Group or any other Blue365 Vendor) may be responsible for allowing you to use your Voucher for the Cash Value based on the money you actually paid for your Voucher (i.e., if you paid $20 for a Voucher which gives you $50 of value to the Blue365 Vendor, the Cash Value that you paid is $20, and the Face Value is $50), for a period of time that may extend beyond the Expiration Date on the Voucher. </p>

<p>If you used a Voucher for less than its Face Value, you will not be entitled to a credit, cash or new Voucher equal to the difference between the Face Value and the amount you used, unless otherwise required by law. You may only be entitled to a continuing “redemption value” (as noted above) if the Cash Value (amount that you paid for the Voucher) exceeds the amount you used, subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the applicable Blue365 Vendor or Restaurant and applicable law. For example, if you paid $20 (Cash Value) for a Voucher which entitles you to purchase $50 (Face Value) of product by June 30, 2012 and you make a purchase for $40 (redemption value) on June 1, 2012, you will not be entitled to a credit or cash equal to the difference between the $50 Face Value and the amount you used because the amount you used is greater than the Cash Value. THESE PROVISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW.</p>

<p>Some of the Blue365 Deals are provided for a limited number of purchasers or a limited number of purchases, as specified for the particular Blue365 Deal. Any attempt to obtain more than the permitted number of Vouchers specified for a particular Blue365 Deal by using different or multiple identities, credit cards, addresses, or any other method will void that person's purchases. BCBSA will be the arbiter, in its sole discretion, as to whether purchase characteristics indicate a violation of these rules.</p>

<b><p>4. <u>Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor/ Restaurant Responsibility.</u></b></p>

<p>To be clear, the BCBSA Group markets the Blue365 Deals and acts an as agent in selling the Vouchers on behalf of the Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendors and the Restaurants. But the Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendors and the Restaurants are the issuer of the Voucher. As issuer of the Voucher, the Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendors and Restaurants shall be fully responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the applicable Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor, Restaurant, or its products and services, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed or partially redeemed Vouchers. By purchasing a Blue365 Deal, you acquire the right to print a Voucher issued by the participating Non-Restaurant Blue365 Vendor or Restaurant and to use the Voucher according to its terms and the terms of this Agreement, the other applicable terms and conditions, and applicable law. <b>Whether you choose to print and/or redeem the Voucher is within your sole control and at your sole discretion.</b></p>
