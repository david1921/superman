<P>
<B>II. TERMS OF SALE</B></P>
<P>By
placing an order, you make an offer to Analog
Analytics or any of our publishers, advertisers or other third party
customers and vendors to purchase the vouchers you have selected on
the terms and conditions stated below. For more information, please
view our privacy policy. 
</P>
<P>You are
required to create an account in order to purchase any product. This
is required so we can provide you with easy access to print your
orders, view your past purchases, modify your preferences, and to
ensure permissible use of the product. 
</P>
<P>Vouchers
you purchase are redeemable for goods or services by the seller of
such goods and services, hereinafter defined as &quot;Merchant.&quot;
The Merchant, not Analog Analytics nor Daily News is the seller of
the goods and services.  Merchant is solely responsible for redeeming
any Analog Analytics voucher that you purchase. 
</P>
<P><B>1. Terms
and Conditions for Restaurant-Specific Vouchers</B></P>
<P>For
this section, restaurant means a Merchant who
offers food and beverage for sale in its regular business operations,
and is making such food and beverages available to purchasers of
Analog Analytics vouchers. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Redemption
	frequency is determined by restaurants, and shall be contained in
	the voucher offer. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Use
	of restaurant vouchers for alcoholic
	beverages is at the sole discretion of the restaurant. Restaurant
	agrees to comply with all state laws pertaining to the same. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>It is at
	the discretion of the restaurant to determine whether vouchers can
	be combined with any other restaurant vouchers, third party
	certificates, coupons, or promotions. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Restaurant
	vouchers cannot be used for taxes, tips or
	prior balances, unless permitted by the restaurant. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Voucher
	are valid for dine in only unless otherwise
	stated. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The
	issuing of restaurant credit is at the sole discretion of the
	restaurant unless otherwise required by law. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>None
	of Analog Analytics, Daily News, nor the
	restaurant is responsible for lost or stolen vouchers or restaurant
	voucher reference numbers. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Reproduction,
	sale or trade of vouchers is prohibited
	unless done so in compliance with the law. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Any
	attempted redemption not consistent with these terms &amp;
	conditions will render the voucher void. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Void to
	the extent prohibited by law.</P>
	<LI><P>The
	voucher offer (including, but not limited to,
	any discounts) expires on the date specified on the voucher, except
	that the restaurant may continue to redeem the unused cash value you
	paid for the voucher (which is usually less than the original face
	value of the voucher) to the extent required by applicable law. See
	Section 3 below for a more detailed explanation. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If
	you redeem the voucher for less than its face
	value, you will not be entitled to a credit, cash or new voucher
	equal to the difference between the face value and the amount you
	redeemed, unless otherwise required by law. You will only be
	entitled to a continuing redemption value if the amount that you
	paid for the voucher exceeds the amount you redeemed. For example,
	if you paid $20 for a voucher which entitles you to purchase $50 of
	product and you make a purchase for $40, you will not be entitled to
	a credit or cash equal to the difference between the $50 face value
	and the amount you redeemed. You will not have any redemption value
	because the amount you redeemed is more than what you paid for the
	voucher. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>All
	purchases of vouchers for restaurants may
	have statutory limitations on the amount of the voucher value that
	can be redeemed for alcoholic beverages. For example, for customers
	purchasing vouchers for restaurants in Ohio, the redemption of the
	voucher may be subject to the limitations imposed by the Ohio
	Revised Code Title [43] XLIII, Section 4301.01, which imposes a
	limitation of redeeming vouchers at restaurants that serve both food
	and alcoholic and intoxicating liquor beverages, such that the
	redemption of such voucher can only be applied to alcoholic and
	intoxicating liquor beverages for up to 30% of the value of the
	voucher. Compliance with state statutes or codes (for example, the
	Ohio Revised Code) is the responsibility of the restaurant. Analog
	Analytics’s and Daily News’s sole role in the transaction is as
	a marketing agent for the voucher, and the applicability and
	compliance with any relevant statute or code is solely determined
	and consummated by the restaurant.  Neither Analog Analytics nor
	Daily News has any role in such determination or action on the part
	of the restaurant.</P>
</UL>
<P><B>2. Terms
and Conditions for Non-Restaurant Merchant Vouchers</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Vouchers
	may be applied only to merchandise sold by Merchant, and may not be
	applied to shipping or handling charges. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Limit
	one (1) voucher per redemption. Only one voucher can be used per
	order unless otherwise specified by merchant. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The
	issuing of credit is at the sole discretion of the Merchant
	unless otherwise required by law.</P>
	<LI><P>None
	of Analog Analytics, Daily News, nor the
	Merchant is responsible for lost or stolen voucher or voucher's
	reference number. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Voucher
	cannot be combined with any other vouchers, third party
	certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by
	Merchant.

	<LI><P>Reproduction,
	sale or trade of vouchers is prohibited
	unless done so in compliance with the law. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Any
	attempted redemption not consistent with these terms and conditions
	will render the voucher null and void.

	<LI><P>The
	voucher offer (including, but not limited to,
	any discounts) expires on the date specified on the voucher, except
	that the Merchant may continue to redeem the unused cash amount you
	paid for the voucher (which is usually less than the original face
	value of the voucher) to the extent required by applicable law. See
	section 3 for a more detailed explanation.</P>
	<LI><P>If
	you redeem the voucher for less than its face
	value, you will not be entitled to a credit, cash or a new voucher
	equal to the difference between the face value and the amount you
	redeemed, unless otherwise required by law. You will only be
	entitled to a continuing redemption value if the amount that you
	paid for the voucher exceeds the amount you redeemed. For example,
	if you paid $20 for a voucher which entitles you to purchase $50 of
	product and you make a purchase for $40, you will not be entitled to
	a credit or cash equal to the difference between the $50 face value
	and the amount you redeemed. You will not have any redemption value
	because the amount you redeemed is more than what you paid for the
	voucher.</P>

Additional Terms and Conditions for All Analog Analytics Products</B></P>
<P>All
vouchers printed from the Site  are
promotional vouchers that are offered to customers below their face
value and shall be subject to these Terms of Use and the Merchant’s
restrictions. The Merchant is the seller of the goods or services
which you are purchasing.</P>
<P>As
issuer of the vouchers, the Merchant shall be fully responsible for
any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and
costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in
part by the Merchant, as well as for any unclaimed property liability
arising from unredeemed vouchers. Vouchers are redeemable in their
entirety only and may not be redeemed incrementally.  According to
the laws of the respective states in which you purchased your
voucher, and in which you wish to redeem your voucher at the
Merchant, the Merchant is responsible for allowing you to redeem your
voucher for the cash value based on the money you actually paid for
your voucher (i.e. if you paid $20 for a voucher which gives you $50
of value to the Merchant, the cash value that you paid is $20, not
$50), for a period of time that may extend beyond the expiration date
on the voucher. While the expiration date on the voucher dictates the
last date that you can use your voucher at Merchant for the
promotional offer which is stated on the voucher, state laws (which
vary state-by-state, and which are generally made available by each
state on the web) may provide that the Merchant is responsible for
honoring the cash value that you paid for your voucher for a period
of time beyond the expiration date stated on the voucher. If
applicable, this is a statutory provision which applies to the
Merchant, and it is the sole responsibility of the Merchant (and in
no way the responsibility of Analog Analytics or Daily News, as
neither Analog Analytics nor Daily News is the Merchant, has any
obligations of the Merchant, or is performing any function other than
selling the promotional voucher on behalf of the Merchant) to comply
with such applicable laws and statutes which may govern the Merchant.</P>
