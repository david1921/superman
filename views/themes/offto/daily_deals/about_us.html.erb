	<h1>Who We Are</h1>
	<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.offto.com">www.OffTo.com</a> is the first travel website devoted entirely to providing fabulous deals on customized LGBT getaways in the U.S. and abroad. Our getaways bundle exceptional accommodations with social, cultural and recreational activities and diversions. Our travel experts design each package based on the interests and preferences of LGBT travelers – and negotiate the best possible price at an average of 40-50% below retail value. With over four decades of experience in LGBT event planning, web-based travel services, marketing / communication and customer relations, OffTo’s founders are excited to provide this unmatched resource to you.</p>

	<h2>Our Travelers</h2>
	<p>LGBT individuals travel more frequently and take longer trips than the average person. When deciding where to go and what to do, LGBT travelers select specific accommodations and activities according to several personal interests and needs. Over the last ten years, consumer research revealed prominent travel behaviors, preferences and concerns amongst LGBT people – which in turn, fueled rapid growth of the LGBT travel and tourism industry. Destination cities, airlines, hotels and several others created targeted campaigns and services specifically for LGBT travelers. There are exclusive LGBT travel sites, but they specialize in one kind of experience, like cruises or day trips. The LGBT community includes very diverse leisure travel preferences and capabilities, but its members also share concerns about friendliness, comfort, safety, comfort and convenience. OffTo.com is the first website to find and book LGBT getaway packages that meet every interest and need.</p>

	<h2>Our Getaways</h2>
	<p>No matter where you like to stay, what you like to do or how much you want to spend – OffTo.com has a fabulous LGBT getaway just for you.

Similarly, the activities and diversions in our packages correspond to specific LGBT leisure interests, including outdoor excursions, city history tours, arts / culture, spa services, dining, LGBT events, live entertainment, nightlife and many more.</p>
