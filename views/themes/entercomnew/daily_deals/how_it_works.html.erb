			  <h3 class="faq">What is the Today's Deal?</h3>
				<p>Each day one incredible deal is featured as the Today's Deal. The offer is only available for a limited amount of time, so make sure to check back frequently so you don't miss out!</p>
				<h3 class="faq">How do I buy today's Today's Deal?</h3>
				<p>Click on the "Buy Now" button before midnight on the day the offer expires. Send the deal to your friends and tweet it, facebook it or text it to everyone you think might be interested.</p>
				<h3 class="faq">What happens after I buy a Today's Deal?</h3>
				<p>After you make a purchase, you'll receive the Today's Deal voucher to print out via email. Take the Today's Deal to the store or merchant any time before the expiration date to enjoy the fruits of your labor.</p>
				<h3 class="faq">What if I want to use just part of the Today's Deal voucher and save the rest for later?</h3>
				<p>Sorry, you're going to have to use that sweet deal in just one visit. However, some merchants may be willing to work with you if this situation arises.</p>
				<h3 class="faq">If my name is on the Today's Deal voucher, can the merchant charge my account?</h3>
				<p>No. The merchant does not have access to any credit card information, this information is secure and not shared. They do have access to a list of purchasers and the voucher number to validate and redeem the deal.</p>
				<h3 class="faq">Is the transaction safe for me to use?</h3>
				<p>Yes. The transaction uses SSL and other industry standard security features to ensure that no one else has access to your credit card information.</p>
				<h3 class="faq">When I gift the Today's Deal to a friend, will they have access to my account information?</h3>
				<p>No, on the Today's Deal voucher, there is a record of the transaction, the purchaser's name and the gifted consumer's name, along with a unique 8-digit code. The payment information is secure on a site that no consumer has access to.</p>
				<h3 class="faq">Can I combine the Today's Deal with other offers the merchant might have presented previously?</h3>
				<p>No, each Today's Deal has its own terms.</p>
				<h3 class="faq">What if the merchant does not honor the offer?</h3>
				<p>We go out of our way to vet each advertiser and make sure they live up to our high standards. On the rare occurrence that something happens and you're not satisfied, we will refund the offer.</p>
				<h3 class="faq">What if I miss the expiration date?</h3>
				<p>If you miss the expiration date on your deal, take heart, all is not lost!  While the additional discounts are no longer available, you are still entitled to goods and services equal to the paid value of the voucher. To the extent required by applicable law, after the Deal Expiration Date, Merchant shall permit the purchaser to redeem the Certificate for the goods and services of the Merchant in the amount of the cash paid by purchaser, until that cash amount is redeemed in full.  The Certificates will not be subject to any fees (including without limitation any usage, dormancy, inactivity or service fees).</p>
				<p>For example, if you spend $25 to buy a $50 voucher for your new favorite restaurant, but are unable to get there before the expiration date, you will still be entitled to $25 of food, drink and good times. The merchant is responsible by law to honor the certificate as noted above.</p>
