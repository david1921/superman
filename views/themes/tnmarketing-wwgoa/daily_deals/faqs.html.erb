<h4>What is the Shop Deals?</h4>
<p>Your one stop for incredible deals that features products and/or services for the woodworking enthusiast. These great offers are only available for a limited amount of time, so make sure to check back frequently...you don't want to miss out!</p>

<h4>How do I buy today's Shop Deals?</h4>
<p>Click on the "Buy Now" button before 
midnight on the day the offer expires.</p>

<h4>What happens after I buy a Shop Deals?</h4>
<p>After you make a purchase, you'll 
receive the Shop Deals email with a voucher attached. In the voucher will be a coupon code that can be redeemed online (or in some cases by phone) from a merchant's website. </p>

<h4>What if I want to use just part 
of the Shop Deals voucher and save the rest for later? </h4>
<p>Make sure to read the fine print on that sweet deal. Every offer has its own redemption rules and each merchant's website handles it differently.</p>

<h4>If my name is on the Shop Deals voucher, can the merchant charge my account? </h4>
<p>No. The merchant does not have your 
account information. That is held by Analog Analytics, the software 
company that processes the transaction for the publisher. </p>

<h4>Is the transaction safe for me to use?</h4>
<p>Yes. The transaction uses SSL and other 
industry standard security features to ensure that no one else has access 
to your credit card information.  </p>

<h4>When I gift the Shop Deals to a friend, will they have access to my account information? </h4>
<p>No, on the Shop Deals voucher, 
there is a record of the transaction, the purchaser's name and the 
gifted consumer's name, along with a unique 8-digit code.  The 
payment information is secure on a site that no consumer has access 
to.  </p>

<h4>Can I combine the Shop Deals with other offers the merchant might have presented previously? </h4>
<p>No, each Shop Deals has its own 
terms.  </p>

<h4>What if the merchant does not honor the offer?</h4>
<p>We go out of our way to vet each advertiser 
and make sure they live up to our high standards.  We will also 
provide recent reviews or testimonials to help you get a better feel 
for what you are buying. On the rare occurrence that something happens 
and you're not satisfied, we (through Analog Analytics) will refund 
the offer.  </p>

<h4>What if I miss the expiration date?</h4>
<p>If you miss the expiration date on 
your deal, take heart, all is not lost! While the additional discounts 
are no longer available, you are still entitled to goods and services 
equal to the paid value of the voucher. </p>

<h4>What if I have more questions?</h4>
<p>Feel free to email <%= mail_to(@publisher.support_email_address, nil, :target => "_blank") %> or call (877) 538-4617.
The Analog Analytics teams will be more than happy to answer any additional questions you may have. </p>
